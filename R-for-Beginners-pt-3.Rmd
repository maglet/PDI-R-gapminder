#Functions
Functions are discete units of R code that allow you to perform specific tasks. 
You can find functions:

* __In the R base package__: no extra installation required. 
* __In external packages__: because R is open source, many people create their 
own functions for specific purposes and make them available in the CRAN repository. 
* __Make your own!__: you can write your own functions. 

We'll be using functions from the base package in this tutorial.

Now we'll go over some really useful functions to use in R.

###Loading files
You can use the assignment operator to load tabular data into R. 

Let's use a data table called **gapminder.csv** that contains population, gross domestic product, and life expectancy information for countries worldwide

####Downloading files
You can download the file at this address: 
[here]("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv")

But why not use R to do the downloading for you? That's what the **download.file**
function is for. 

Here's the code to download a file in R.
```{r}
download.file("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/swcarpentry/r-novice-gapminder/gh-pages/_episodes_rmd/data/gapminder-FiveYearData.csv", #the URL that contains the file 
              destfile = "gapminder.csv")  #What to call the file
```

See what I mean about '=' being used for something different in R? It's used to 
give the function's __arguments__ values. Arguments are information that the 
function needs to run. In this case, we need to know where the file is online 
and where you want to store it locally.

* The __url__ argument specifies where the file is on the web
* The __destfile__ argument specifies where you want the downloaded data to be 
stored. If you don't include a file path, the function saves the file in the 
working directory.
* Make sure both the url and the destination file are in quotes. 

If you're not sure what arguments a function can take, type "help(FunctionName)".
This command will open the help file for the function in the lower right of the 
R Studio console. 

For example, this is how you'd pull up the help file for __download.file__
```{r}
help(download.file) # get R documentation for download.file function
```

It takes a while to learn how to effectively read the R help files, but don't worry. We will explain all of the functions and arguments you need in this tutorial. You shouldn't have to rely much on the help files. 

####Loading data into R
Now that you've downloaded the data you, you can load it into R. We're going to 
use the assignment operator and the **read.csv** function.

Below is the syntax to read the __gapminder.csv__ file into R.

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("gapminder.csv") #reads data from the csv file
```

Now your global environment looks something like this: 

![](Supplemental/globalenv2.png)

There's a new dataset called __gapminder__. Descriptive variable names are 
good.

###Inspecting your data
What you can do with the data set in r depends on the content and type of 
data in __gapminder__. 

To find out the format that R is storing the data in, you can use the function
__class__. Every variable in R has a class, including the variables __x__ from earlier. Let's see what class these two items are. 

```{r}
x<-4
class(x)
```

__x__ is a numeric variable.  

```{r}
phrase<-"This is not in a comment"
class(phrase)
```
__phrase__ is character, as expected. 
```{r}
gapminder<-read.csv("gapminder.csv")
class(gapminder)
```

gapminder is a __data frame__. This is a special R format that makes dealing 
with tabular data easier.  

* __Each column is a variable__. In this case, it's patient id, gender, and 30 
days of antibody levels.
* __Each row is an observation__. In this case, it's all of the patients in 
the study. 
* __Each column must contain the same data type__ (for example, all numeric)
* __The data set must be "rectangular"__, which means all variables (columns) must 
have the same number of observations (elements).

To see how the data are formatted in a data frame, you can use the 
__head__ command. It takes one argument (the data frame).

```{r}
head(gapminder) #displays the first 6 elements of all columns
```

By default, __head__ will display the first 6 values of each column in the data frame. 

If you want to see the entire data frame in a new tab, click on the name of the
variable in the __Environment__ window. A spreadsheet will open as a new tab in 
the editor (upper left).

To find out what data type is contained in each column, use the __str__ command 
(which stands for structure) to get more information.

```{r}
str(gapminder)
```

By default, __str__ displays the dimensions of the data frame and the name of each variable followed by 
the type of data (__Factor__ or __integer__) and the first 10 elements in the 
column. 

In this dataset, the year, pop, lifeExp and gdpPercap contain numbers (num or int). 

But what does it mean to say that __country__ and __continent__ are factors? __Factors__ 
are categorical data that describe the observation.

* __country__ is a factor with 142 levels, the number of countries in this dataset.
* __continent__ is a factor with 5 levels, the 5 continents represented in this dataset 

You can use factors to split the data subgroups. We'll come back to this point in pt 4 of this lesson. 

Finally, to get the min, max, median, mean, and quartiles for the numerica data,
and the counts for the factor variables, you can use the __summary__ command. 
```{r}
summary(gapminder)
```

###Take home points: 
* You can find functions in the base R installation, packages, or create your own
* Functions can help you download files (download.file) and import data (read.csv)
* Base R has usefil functions for examining values and data (class, str, head, summary)

###Challenge Questions
1. How would you find the help file for par: a function that alters graphics parameters?

2. What is the second argument of the t.test function?

3. What happens if you don't use the destfile argument in the download.file function?
