#Learning Objectives

## After completing this tutorial, you will be able to 
* load tabular data into R
* calculate summary statistics for these data
* create a publication-quality graph

#Introducing R Studio
R studio makes programming in R easier. See what the different windows
represent below

**Layout Overview:** ![](Rstudio.png)
**Upper left**: where you write your scripts  
**Upper right**: view the variables  
**Lower left**: where the code is executed  
**Lower Right**: where to view help files, plots, and loaded files  

###Open a script file

###Set your working directory

#R Syntax

One of the hardest things about any programming is remembering the syntax. 
Missing one semicolon or mispelling a variable or function name cause your code 
to fail. Luckily, you can use scripts to save code that you have written, with 
notes to indicate what the code does.

###Assignment operator
One of the most basic things to do in programming is to assign a value to a 
variable. Let's say you want to assign the value 4 to the variable x. 
To do this in R, use the following syntax: 

```{r}
x<-4 #assigns the value 4 to the variable x
```

Now, check your work. When you type in 'x'

```{r}
x #print x to the output screen
```

R outputs the number 4. 

###Why not use =?

The equal sign (=)serves a different purpose in R. Instead of assigning values 
to variables, it's used to define arguments to functions. We'll show you what
this means as we start to use functions later in this tutorial.

###But what about REAL data?

You can also use the assignment operator in conjunction with a function called 
**read.csv** to load tabular data into R. 

Let's use a data table called **inflammation.csv** that contains daily 
antibody levels for 40 days after the administration of a vaccine. The table 
also contains data about the gender of the subjects.

####Downloading files
You can download the file at this address: 
https://github.com/maglet/r-for-beginners/blob/master/inflammation.csv

But why not use R to do the downloading for you? That's what the **download.file**
function is for. 

```{r}
download.file(url="https://github.com/maglet/r-for-beginners/blob/master/inflammation.csv",
              destfile = "inflammation.csv")
```
